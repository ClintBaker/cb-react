            , I've helped facilitate the sale of $20M+ in digital revenue
            annually. I've been a crucial part of the development of bespoke
            business process management software focused on delivering curated
            KPIs in a custom format. Acted as founding developer to bring an MVP
            based on our product management teamâ€™s user requirements, and
            ensured the delivery of quality software on a demanding schedule.
            Always seeking personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through
            a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on JavaScript, where I was
            invited to return as a teaching assistant. Let's build something!
